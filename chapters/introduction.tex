\chapter{Introduction}\label{c:introduction}

In an era of an ever-increasing use of software technologies
for almost any everyday task, the requirement for high quality software is indispensable. To
 that end, several tools leveraging program analysis techniques have been
introduced in the literature, mainly aiming to assist in performance optimization or bug finding.

Those tools may either be highly autonomous or possibly rely on external frameworks to back their reasoning.
A \emph{symbolic execution} framework stands as an example that is highly dependent on an
external constraint solver, otherwise known as theorem prover, that aids it by producing a solution to an input
constraint formula which further directs the execution. These tools essentially try to yield proofs, yet they
are implemented as complex software systems in a common programming language, not being easily extensible.
Declarative programming languages are increasingly becoming preferable over the last few years by
the Computer Science community, with applications that span from program analysis to databases and distributed
systems. The main power of declarative languages is that they allow to focus on the goal, rather than
how to achieve it.
