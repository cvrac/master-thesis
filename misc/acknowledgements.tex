  I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor prof.
Yannis Smaragdakis for giving me the chance to work on such an interesting
topic, within my area of interest, his valuable insights during our discussions
and his constant support that kept me motivated.

  I would also like to thank my labmates at PLaST lab for sharing their
expertise on several occasions and providing suggestions throughout
the whole process.
